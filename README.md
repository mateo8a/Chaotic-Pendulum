#The Chaotic Pendulum

This repo contains a Mathematica notebook that explores various aspects of the damped driven nonlinear pendulum. The equation for this system is:

$$ I \frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + b \frac{d\theta}{dt} + m g d \sin{\theta} = \Gamma \cos{(\omega_F t)} $$





##How to open the Mathematica (.nb) file

Mathematica uses the file extension .nb, which can only be opened with Wolfram-licensed software. For those of you who don't have Mathematica, you can use their CDF Player to open the .nb files. The CDF player can be downloaded for free [here](http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/).
