#The Chaotic Pendulum

This repo contains a Mathematica notebook that explores various aspects of the damped driven nonlinear pendulum. The equation for this system is:

The program allows you to compute:

* The trajectory as a function of time
* The trajectory in phase space 
* The Poincare section 
* The Power Spectrum
* Bifurcation diagrams 

A note on the bifurcation diagrams: even though they are arguably the coolest part of the program, generating one of them can take around 10 hours. I recommend leaving your computer running overnight if you plan on generating one of them.

##How to open the Mathematica (.nb) file

Mathematica uses the file extension .nb, which can only be opened with Wolfram-licensed software. For those of you who don't have Mathematica, you can use their CDF Player to open the .nb files. The CDF player can be downloaded for free [here](http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/).
