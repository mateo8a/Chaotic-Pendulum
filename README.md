#The Chaotic Pendulum

This repo contains a Mathematica notebook that explores various aspects of the nonlinear damped driven pendulum. The equation for this system is:

The program allows you to compute:

* The trajectory as a function of time
* The trajectory in phase space 
* The Poincare section 
* The Power Spectrum
* Bifurcation diagrams 

A note on the bifurcation diagrams: even though they are arguably the coolest part of the program, generating one of them can take around 10 hours. I recommend leaving your computer running overnight if you plan on generating one of them.

##Files included 

The 'Chaotic Pendulum.nb' file is the Mathematica notebook; this is where the program is.

The 'Chaotic Pendulum.wl' file has the code of the .nb file but it can be read without any Wolfram-licensed software.

The 'Project Poster.pdf' file is the poster that I created as part of a class presentation on this topic. It provides a succinct explanation of the chaotic pendulum, along with plots to visualize the difference between regular and chaotic motion.

The '.png' file is an image of the equation that describes the nonlinear damped driven pendulum system.

##How to open the Mathematica (.nb) file

Mathematica uses the file extension .nb, which can only be opened with Wolfram-licensed software. For those of you who don't have Mathematica, you can use their CDF Player to open the .nb files. The CDF player can be downloaded for free [here](http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/).
